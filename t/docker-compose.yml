#
# This Docker Compose recipe is meant for spinning up the
# accompanying data services required to perform development
# and engineering work against SHIELD Storage Gateway software.
#
# It is not meant to be used directly in production, although
# it does act as a decent template for what we will need
# when we do finally launch.
#
# Note that there are no volumes in this recipe.
# Data will not persist across container restarts.
# This is a feature of the test environment, not a bug.
#
# You should never have to run this recipe by hand -- the
# integration test suite handles it for you. However, if you
# need (or want) to:
#
#     PUBLIC_PORT=9077 \
#       docker-compose -p ssg-it -f t/docker-compose.yml up
#
